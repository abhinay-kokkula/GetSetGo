## Overview

**GetSetGo** is a personal knowledge assistant that lets users store text and PDF documents, retrieve relevant information through semantic search, and generate grounded answers using a Large Language Model (LLM).

The system follows a simple workflow:

```text
User Knowledge
      |
      v
    SET
  Ingest and store
      |
      v
    GET
 Retrieve relevant context
      |
      v
    GO
 Generate a useful, grounded response
```

The application is designed around the idea of a **personal second brain**: instead of relying only on the model's general knowledge, the assistant retrieves information from the user's own stored knowledge before generating an answer.

## Why the name "GetSetGo"?

The name represents the three core stages of the application:

* **SET** — set your knowledge by storing notes and documents.
* **GET** — get relevant information from your stored memory when you ask a question.
* **GO** — move from retrieved knowledge to an actionable answer.

In short:

> **SET your knowledge. GET your context. GO with the answer.**

## How It Works

### 1. SET — Knowledge Ingestion

When a user adds text or a PDF, GetSetGo processes the information through an ingestion pipeline:

```text
Text / PDF
   |
   v
Parse
   |
   v
Chunk
   |
   v
Embed
   |
   v
Store in ChromaDB
```

**Parsing** extracts usable text from the input.

**Chunking** divides large text into smaller overlapping sections so individual pieces can be searched effectively.

**Embedding** converts each text chunk into a numerical vector that represents its semantic meaning.

**Vector storage** saves these embeddings and their metadata in ChromaDB.

### 2. GET — Retrieval and Generation

When the user asks a question:

```text
Question
   |
   v
Query Embedding
   |
   v
Semantic Search
   |
   v
Relevant Context
   |
   v
LLM Generation
   |
   v
Answer + Sources
```

The query is converted into an embedding and compared with stored vectors using cosine similarity.

The most relevant chunks are then provided as context to the LLM. The model generates an answer based on that retrieved context and includes source references.

### 3. Feedback-Based Retrieval

GetSetGo records user feedback on retrieved sources.

Positive feedback increases the future retrieval weight of a source, while negative feedback decreases it. This provides a lightweight learning mechanism without retraining the embedding model or LLM.

```text
Retrieved Source
       |
   User Feedback
       |
       v
  Trust Weight
       |
       v
Future Retrieval Ranking
```

| **RAG**               | Retrieval-Augmented Generation; retrieves relevant information before generating an answer. |
| **Embedding**         | A numerical representation of text that captures semantic meaning.                          |
| **Vector Database**   | A database optimized for storing and searching numerical representations of information.    |
| **Semantic Search**   | Search based on meaning rather than exact keyword matching.                                 |
| **Chunking**          | Splitting large documents into smaller sections for efficient retrieval.                    |
| **LLM**               | Large Language Model used to generate natural-language responses.                           |
| **Cosine Similarity** | A measure used to determine how semantically similar two vectors are.                       |
| **Relevance Score**   | A normalized indication of how closely a retrieved chunk matches the query.                 |

## Data and Privacy

GetSetGo stores embeddings and application data locally in the project's database directory.

The embedding model runs locally. However, retrieved context is sent to the configured Groq API for LLM generation. Do not store or submit sensitive information unless you understand the data handling policies of the services you use.

---

## Retrieval Quality

Each retrieved source has a relevance score derived from vector similarity and adjusted using the application's feedback mechanism.

The score should be interpreted as a **retrieval relevance signal**, not as a guarantee that an answer is factually correct.

For reliable responses, the retrieved sources should contain sufficient and accurate information about the user's question.
